# Face_Recognition_Drowsiness_Detection-master
School Attendance AI:
# Problem Statement:
We will solve the above-mentioned challenge by applying deep learning algorithms to live video data.
The solution to this problem is by recognizing the face, mark the attendance, log the individual’s
session time and put a drowsiness alert.

#Face Recognition:
This is a few shot learning live face attendance systems. The model should be able to real-time
identify attending students in the live class based on few images of students.

# Drowsiness detector:
This will detect facial landmarks and extract the eye regions. The algorithm should be able to identify
students who are not attentive and drowsing in the class.

The eye aspect ratio is mostly constant when an eye is open and is getting close to zero while closing an eye.

The eye aspect ratio between height and width of the eye is computed by equation shown above.

# Scope of project:
A. Model should be able to identify students’ faces and log session time active on webcam
using minimum reference images.
B. Model should be able to identify drowsing students.
C. Models should work on the real-time webcam video feed.
D. Model must be deployed on AWS/GCP/Azure platform as an end-to-end solution.
E. Model accuracy must surpass the 95% accuracy (Industry standard).
F. Model must be accessible via a web application (Streamlit) for demo purposes.

# Future Work:
The UI for real time face recognition has not been built yet. The future goal would be to use javascript to built realtime face recognition system
The project also needs to be deployed on cloud computing servers. 
Work needs to be done on the drowsiness detection part. Apart from eyes, the facial expression could also be used in detecting drowsiness.

# Conclusions:
Face recognition technology has come a long way in the last twenty years. 
The proposed approach for drowsiness detection system is very simple in terms of calculation.
